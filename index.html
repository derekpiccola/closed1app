<p>Each email sent contains an easy, automated way for you to cease receiving emails from us, or to change your expressed interests. If you wish to do this, simply follow the instructions at the end of any email. If you have received unwanted, unsolicited emails sent via this system or purporting to be sent via this system, please forward a copy of that email with your comments to info@closedoneapp.com for removal from our mailing list.
